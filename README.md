# torchbug-bot

A twitter bot made to send daily, pleading tweets to [@TESOnline](https://twitter.com/TESOnline).

Uses [Twitter's API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) and [Netlify's scheduled functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/scheduled-functions/) to trigger a daily Netlify build, which triggers a tweet.
